your_variable_here = "when you see this, replace it with your code"

## Section ONE

# Complete the following print statement to print out "Hello, COSC1010"
print("Hello, COSC1010")

# Assign the string above to a variable named hello_message and print that variable
hello_message = "have a good day"
print("hello_message")

# Assign the string "cowboy joe" to a variable, and print that variable with title casing
joe= "cowboy joe"
print("joe")

# Complete the following f-string print message 
    # You will need to create your own variables and insert them  
    # the final message should read `The University of Wyoming was founded in 1886`

print(f"The {your_variable_here} was founded in {your_variable_here}")

# Now let's do some math with variables 
    # Create two variables x and y and assign them the values 5 and 10 respectively 
    # Complete the following print statements using your variables
    #All math must be done within the braces in the f-strings
print(f"x + y = {your_variable_here}")
print(f"x - y = {your_variable_here}")
print(f"x * y = {your_variable_here}")
print(f"x / y = {your_variable_here}")
